# AI Discussion
There's a lot to pay attention to in the news these days. We're going to have a discussion about some part of the news, but first you need to make a proposal for what exactly our discussion will be about.

### Topic Proposals
1. Read the most recent issue of the MIT Technology Review newsletter called "The Algorithm", [which is linked here](https://mailchi.mp/187102ca2036/4rfvjf7hka-778057?e=875ea3d054).
2. Pick one of those stories (or follow a rabbit hole and pick some other current+relevant story you find online) that you think would make an interesting starting point for a discussion. 
3. Go to [flipgrid.com/smithai](https://flipgrid.com/smithai) and record a video (3 minutes max) in which you tell us:
   - what you think the title of our discussion should be
   - what article you think we should all read before having that discussion
   - a brief summary of that article
   - two or three questions that you think would be good discussion-starters
4. Before next week, Mr. Smith will pick one of your proposals as the basis for a class discussion. Watch your email in case he needs to reach out to ask for links or other clarifying questions.
